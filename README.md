### Additional Notes:

- MongoDB Setup: The guide assumes MongoDB is set up and running locally. You may need to adjust instructions if you're using a MongoDB hosting service or a Docker container for MongoDB.
- Environment Variables: You might need additional environment variables specific to your application. Documenting them in the `README.md` is crucial for new developers to get started quickly.
- Contributing Guide and License: Replace `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE.md` with the actual paths to your contributing guide and license file. If you don't have these files yet, consider adding them to your repository.

This template provides a starting point. You should tailor the `README.md` to fit the specifics of your project and any additional sections you feel are necessary to properly explain your project and how to get it running.
